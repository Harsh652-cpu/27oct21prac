 A logical text style implies that the text(on which the style is applied) has some special meaning.For example,by using logical text styles,you may indicate if the text should be displayed as code or as bold text.Each browser handles logical text styles in a unique way.The various logical texts are:-
 <br>

 - < DFN >:-Displays the text in italics.You can use this style for defining a single word.
 - < em >:-Displays text in italics.You can use this style for emphasizing a single line.
